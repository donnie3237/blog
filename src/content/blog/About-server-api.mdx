# About server api

I think creating a server sounds fun, but I’ve discovered a few things after starting to code on the server side. Here are my thoughts:

## Clean Architecture

People have different opinions on this topic, but writing code with a linter and using patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller), MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), and DDD (Domain-Driven Design) is essential for readability and maintainability. These practices help ensure that the code can be easily understood and modified by others or even by the original developer after some time.

## Algorithms

A good algorithm enhances the efficiency of the written code and reduces the risk of vulnerabilities. Focusing on Big O notation to optimize the program’s performance and considering switching to more efficient frameworks can make a significant difference. Understanding middleware design is crucial for intercepting and enhancing the server’s security.

## SwaggerUI

It can be quite challenging if there’s no documentation about the API. SwaggerUI comes in handy for checking available paths, required keys, and data models. I believe SwaggerUI is very effective in providing a clear and comprehensive API documentation.

## Tracker

I’ve tried using Sentry to detect and notify me of bugs via email. It’s pretty impressive. At the end of the month, it summarizes the data on which paths were accessed and what occurred throughout the month. This tool is invaluable for monitoring and maintaining the server’s health and performance.

## Security

Security is a critical aspect of server API development. Implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and API keys, is crucial for protecting your API endpoints. Additionally, regularly updating dependencies and using security-focused libraries can help mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

## Testing

Automated testing is vital for ensuring the reliability of your API. Writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests can help catch bugs early in the development process. Tools like Jest, Mocha, and Postman can be used for comprehensive testing of your server API.

## Scalability

Designing your server to handle increasing loads is essential for maintaining performance as your user base grows. Techniques like load balancing, horizontal scaling, and utilizing cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure) can help distribute the workload and prevent bottlenecks.

## Logging and Monitoring

Proper logging and monitoring are essential for diagnosing issues and understanding the server's behavior. Tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Prometheus, and Grafana can provide detailed insights into the server’s performance and help with troubleshooting.
