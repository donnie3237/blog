## UI Framework

Deciding on a framework for building our web or application projects ปัจจุบัน is quite overwhelming due to the numerous available options. It's quite challenging to make a decision. Here are some examples:

### Web Framework

* React: I'm quite confident that this is a good choice and should be usable for a long time because it has a large community. It's a tool I use frequently, mainly developed by Meta, but it also supports many plugins.
* Solid: This is developed as an improvement over React, focusing on performance by using signals, which reduces the need for re-rendering that could negatively impact performance.
* Svelte: Initially, it seemed to have good performance and was easy to understand. However, it started to add more features over time, making it a bit more complex to write. I haven't worked with this framework much, so I can't say much about it.
* Vue: This has a large community, but I have little experience with this framework, so I can't say much. However, from what I've heard, it's quite easy to write and understand.
* Next.js: In terms of rendering framework, I think Next.js has been developed very well. It's easy to use, has a large community, and everything seems quite okay for real-world use.
* Astro: This is relatively new but quite easy to use. However, I don't see it being used much in real-world projects; it's mostly used for personal blogs or portfolios.

### CSS Framework

* Tailwind CSS: I use this framework frequently and think it has a long way to go. Personally, I think using something like DaisyUI or DoseUI along with it could be a great choice.
* Bootstrap: This is quite an old framework with high reliability.
* MUI: This is used with React and is a pretty good styled components library with many options to choose from.
* StyleX: This framework is developed by Meta, which believes that writing styled components is beneficial, and Meta uses it themselves.

### Native App

* Flutter
* React Native
* ElectronJS
* Tauri
* .Net
* Kotlin & Swift

## Too many framework

 Sigh , in 2023 alot of framework in javascript is F\*\*\* much and it's hard to makr decision about it, and many framework from anothe language and too many CSS framework to choose either, but i think, "Use your love Framework is good thing in 2023" cuz if it can make your job more productive more security and performant
